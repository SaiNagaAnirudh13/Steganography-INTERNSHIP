Secure Data Hiding in Images using Steganography

📌 Overview

This project implements image steganography using Python and OpenCV. It allows users to hide and retrieve secret messages inside an image by modifying pixel values. The hidden message is only accessible with the correct passcode, ensuring secure communication.

🚀 Features

✔ Hide Secret Messages inside an image without visible distortion.
✔ Retrieve Hidden Messages using a passcode.
✔ Passcode Protection ensures only authorized users can access the message.
✔ Lightweight & Efficient, requiring only Python and OpenCV.
✔ Cross-Platform Compatibility, running on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

🛠️ Installation

1️⃣ Install Python 3.x from Python.org.
2️⃣ Install OpenCV 

💡 How It Works

🔹 The user enters a message and passcode to hide it inside an image.
🔹 The modified image is saved with no visible changes.
🔹 To retrieve the message, the user enters the correct passcode.
🔹 If the passcode is incorrect, access is denied.

📷 Example Usage

🔹 Encryption: The message is hidden inside an image.
🔹 Decryption: The message is retrieved only if the correct passcode is entered.

🔮 Future Enhancements
🔹 Advanced Encryption – Adding AES or RSA encryption for extra security.
🔹 Video Steganography – Hiding messages inside video frames.
🔹 GUI Interface – Creating a user-friendly interface for easier use.
